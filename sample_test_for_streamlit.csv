in latest twist in japan election drama tokyo s koike says won t seek seat tokyo reuters tokyo governor yuriko koike whose new party is challenging japanese prime minister shinzo abe s ruling bloc in the oct national election said she would percent not run in the poll the latest twist in a drama giving voters whiplash speculation has persisted that koike a former ldp member and defense minister would resign to run for a seat in parliament needed to make a bid for the premiership i have been saying i will not run for the election from the beginning koike said in an interview with the yomiuri newspaper reported on tuesday i m percent not running for the election she later repeated the comment to reporters if koike does not personally contest this election then analysts believe she would hope her party positions itself to win the next national poll and that she gains a voter boost from the tokyo olympics abe announced the snap election last week in hopes his liberal democratic party led coalition would keep its majority in parliament s lower house where it held a two thirds super majority before the chamber was dissolved but koike s new party of hope launched just last week as a reformist conservative alternative to abe s equally conservative ldp has clouded the outlook amid signs voters are disillusioned with abe after nearly five years in power koike s dilemma was whether to run for a seat now and face a backlash from voters for quitting as governor little more than a year since she defied the ldp to run successfully for the post or risk letting a shot at the top job slip through her fingers some analysts saw her decision not to seek a seat now as a sign koike thinks her party s momentum is fading she must have thought it would not be worthwhile abandoning the post of tokyo governor to become a head of an opposition said tetsuro kato a professor emeritus at hitotsubashi university koike has been getting negative media coverage for saying she would exclude candidates who do not agree with her party s policies a stance seen as barring liberal members of the failed main opposition democratic party from joining leaders of the democratic party a fractious mix of conservatives and liberals decided last week it would not run candidates of its own but let members run from koike s party koike s comment was applauded by some as an effort to ensure policy consistency but by others as a dictatorial maneuver she s branding a very new party and has to make clear what it stands for but the danger is that while abe owned the arrogance of power space she is now vying for some of that said jeffrey kingston director of asian studies at temple university japan abe s support rates fell earlier this year due to suspected cronyism scandals and many voters perception that he had grown complacent and arrogant after nearly five years in office his rating later rebounded but dropped again to percent in the latest poll by public broadcaster nhk koike s party is insisting those who want to run on its ticket sign a policy pledge including revising the pacifist constitution and exercising the right of collective self defense or militarily aiding allies under attack defense a document seen by reuters showed many liberals balk at those policies koike s party on tuesday unveiled a list of candidates for the lower house election that compares with seats needed for a simple majority the party plans to announce more candidates in the coming days but a senior party member conceded that it will be a tall order to win a majority although fielding candidates is a very high mountain we would like to finish climbing it on the other hand in actuality it would be considerably difficult for us alone to gain a majority even if we fielded said goshi hosono a founding member of the party and former environment minister further complicating the outlook liberals from the democratic party launched a constitutional democratic party of japan the csdp could split the opposition vote and help abe s bloc keep its majority but by how much is tough to predict koike is tough she s resilient and she can tap into the fact that abe s negative ratings are pretty high and a lot of people out there are unhappy with him kingston said,1
any u s military transgender ban could face major legal challenge new york reuters president donald trump s announcement on wednesday on banning transgender people from serving in the u s military unleashed a storm of legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to file suit trump s surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing former president barack obama s policy would go into effect nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join but if the u s defense department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military the pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight legal experts say there s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military said jon davidson legal director for lgbt rights group lambda legal they are currently serving without a problem there hasn t been an extraordinary cost there hasn t been disruption experts say singling out transgender people would violate their rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the u s constitution joshua block at the american civil liberties union said his inbox was flooded with emails about trump s ban including from service members i think the most important thing for people to understand is that for the immediate future nothing can happen to them trump s tweet is not self executing said block a senior staff attorney on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt issues under obama the defense department declared in june that transgender people could serve openly in the armed forces the pentagon was considering a second step of allowing openly transgender people to enlist when trump on wednesday issued three tweets saying transgender people would not be allowed to serve any capacity in the military citing disruptions and medical costs the pentagon referred all questions to the white house where press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump made the decision in consultation with his national security team and that the defense department would work with the white house and take the lead on a lawful implementation sarah warbelow the human rights campaign s legal director said trump s declaration amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex and identity and was therefore open to legal challenge the courts do provide quite a bit of deference to the military in determining its own policies she said however that doesn t mean the military is above the law but the pentagon may have a clearer path to a ban should it merely prevent new transgender recruits from signing up if the ban applies only to those seeking to enlist the legal bar would be higher because the military already has wide leeway to exclude classes of people based on medical needs block said if trump did want to remove all existing transgender servicemembers from the ranks it was unclear what legal mechanism he could use to forcibly discharge u s troops if transgender people disclosed their identity as a result of the obama policy and that policy is then changed they would have a legal recourse should they be arbitrarily denied their jobs and benefits davidson said even those seeking to enlist might allege the government banned transgender individuals in an arbitrary way and without good reason but at least one legal expert said a challenge would be difficult to mount because courts typically defer to the government on military matters eugene fidell who teaches military law at yale law school said even if discharged transgender service members asked for military reviews of their cases and won those decisions could be overturned by the secretaries of the four branches of the military who are political appointees it would difficult to convince federal courts to reverse the secretaries fidell said,1
narrowed travel ban could sow confusion in u s and abroad experts say washington reuters the supreme court s criteria for who can be barred from entering the united states under president donald trump s travel ban may confuse the u s officials overseas charged with implementing it and trigger a new round of lawsuits experts said people with a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states are spared from the temporary ban affecting people from six muslim majority countries and all refugees that the justices on monday allowed to go partially into effect there s no precedent for something like this that i m aware of said jeffrey gorsky a former legal adviser to the state department s visa office referring to the new bona fide standard gorsky said the standard is likely to sow confusion among u s consular officials who have to make visa decisions and could require another court decision to determine what constitutes a connection to the united states sufficient to allow entry the supreme court agreed to decide the legality of trump order in its next term which begins in october justice clarence thomas argued that the court should have granted trump s request to implement the travel ban in full while the legal fight continues today s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding on peril of contempt whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the united states have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country thomas wrote joined by two fellow conservative justices in monday s ruling the high court gave a few examples of connections that qualify for individuals a close family relationship is required bona fide connections to entities it said must be formal and documented that would include students who have been admitted to a u s school and workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an american company the court said it noted that trump s executive order already allowed for case by case waivers for people with connections to the country on the other hand the justices said relationships created for the purposes of evading the travel ban will not be considered valid for instance an immigration agency cannot add foreigners to client lists and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion the march order called for a day ban on travelers from libya iran somalia sudan syria and yemen and a day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures trump cited national security concerns as the reason for the order stephen legomsky chief counsel for u s citizenship and immigration services under former president barack obama said lawsuits could claim that a bona fide relationship was ignored while legomsky said he believes the vast majority of cases will be clear cut courts will have to determine whether visiting a close friend or taking part in a wedding could also qualify in theory you could say if somebody is coming for tourism and has made a reservation for a hotel there s now a u s interest in bringing them to the united states the hotel is a u s entity gorsky said some lawyers also said the vagueness of the bona fide standard was license for the trump administration to interpret it broadly it s just like a green light to the government to do what it wants to do said kiyanoush razaghi a maryland based immigration attorney who deals with primarily iranian clients who is going to tell us what is the definition of bona fide relationship the difficult job of judging foreigners claimed connections could land back in the lower courts in maryland and hawaii that had originally blocked trump s travel ban said stephen vladeck a professor university of texas school of law we could have dozens of these cases between now and september vladeck said adding that the supreme court would not be likely to weigh in on them on a case by case basis david martin a former u s department of homeland security official and now a professor at the university of virginia said the ruling was carefully tailored and should be manageable for officials to enact part of the reason martin said is the case by case waiver process that was already envisioned in the executive order i think there will be some litigation over the extent of the reach of this bona fide relationship but i don t think it will be as burdensome as the dissenters suggest martin said,1
out in the cold new u s budget priorities threaten housing aid programs reuters when paul ryan speaker of the u s house of representatives talks of social mobility about helping struggling americans move out of impoverished areas to give them greater opportunity shiva daniels is the kind of person he has in mind a federal housing voucher allowed daniels to escape her crime plagued neighborhood in dallas texas and move her four children to the suburb of garland that move helped daniels find a good job working for a property management company today she cherishes the small two bedroom house she rents with a yard where her children can safely play away from drugs and gang violence in dallas but if daniels were to lose the monthly stipend she receives she has no doubt what would happen i would have to move back she said i wouldn t be able to afford it pulling americans out of poverty is a subject close to ryan s heart and president donald trump has frequently talked about aiding the inner cities but the housing assistance provided by the u s department of housing and urban development or hud could fall victim to fiscal policies under consideration by the white house and congress which include a massive tax cut and increased military spending according to a dozen congressional aides who spoke to reuters while the white house has not been specific about its plans for hud the budget process remains in flux it has called for a billion cut in non military discretionary domestic programs in the next fiscal year which likely will dramatically impact safety net programs that are not entitlements such as medicare and social security budget experts said altogether housing advocates paint a bleak picture of the landscape for low income housing under the trump administration they warn that deep cuts to housing funds would force some people out of their homes and hollow out grant programs meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods there is also a ripple effect they warn rental prices would likely rise alongside declines in affordable housing projects and vouchers available to renters that would make it tougher for renters to save enough to eventually buy homes it s a bad cycle said carol galante a former top hud official during the obama administration it puts pressure on the rental market the rents are higher and higher so people can save less and less hud provides about million americans with some form of housing assistance either through vouchers to renters subsidies to landlords or public housing projects which comprises about percent of its budget it also sends about billion annually directly to communities through grants even so only about one quarter of those eligible for assistance in the country receive it housing advocates say changes to its budget or mandate would be directly felt in low income communities they point out that in when the legislatively mandated budget cuts known as sequestration hit hud more than renters nationwide lost their housing support douglas rice an expert at the center for budget and policy priorities a nonpartisan think tank in washington estimates that for every percent cut in hud s budget renters would lose their assistance but critics of the agency including some republican lawmakers say its anti poverty and community development programs are inefficient and wasteful and that it has failed to live up to its mission today the proportion of americans who live below the poverty line percent is about the same as it was years ago hud has also at times had difficulty shaking the image of a bureaucratic agency that is vulnerable to corruption it was at the center of a bid rigging scandal during the reagan administration and alphonso jackson the hud secretary under president george w bush resigned in amid allegations that he steered contracts to friends charges were never brought against jackson there are some sports teams that never seem to gel i think we re a little like that at hud said bud albright a washington lobbyist who worked at the agency when republican jack kemp was secretary in the early s trump who has not been specific on his plans for the agency selected ben carson to lead hud the former neurosurgeon and republican presidential candidate won senate confirmation last week although carson s views hew closely to republican orthodoxy on how too much government can discourage people from working hard his upbringing in inner city detroit gives him a unique perspective his mother received food stamps to provide for her family and he was raised around housing assistance programs similar to those he will now manage carson who declined requests for interviews by reuters has pledged to fight to protect hud s housing assistance budget and preserve the agency s community development initiatives he also said he would push to include funding to rehabilitate public housing facilities in trump s proposed trillion infrastructure plan but given the white house s determination to cut domestic spending carson will have to fight for every dollar a hud spokesman declined to comment on which programs could be hurt by any possible budget cuts the white house s office of management and budget did not respond to a request for comment congress too is looking to narrow hud s reach ryan has called for work requirements and time limits on those who receive housing assistance similar to how child support food assistance and other welfare benefits function tax reform spearheaded by ryan and kevin brady the house ways and means chairman could ultimately do away with a key tax credit used by developers to build affordable housing or could drastically curtail the credit s use one vocal critic of hud is jeb hensarling republican chair of the house financial services committee which oversees the housing agency hensarling plans to introduce legislation this year to narrow the trillion portfolio of the federal housing administration which helps low income and first time homebuyers purchase homes his office said hensarling has said he fears that if home values drop the fha would require another federal bailout as it did in when it received a taxpayer funded infusion of billion to cover its losses if the cuts to hud s budget are as severe as some expect those who are on waiting lists now for vouchers will be staying on them for a very long time and recipients such as shiva daniels who has been receiving assistance for six years will be at risk of seeing that support end that would mean losing her small house with the yard she sees as a safe haven for her children it might not feel like it s a big deal but it is daniels said when you feel good it allows you to do better and do better for them,1
